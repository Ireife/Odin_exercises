    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <div>   
    <p>In <em>Nigeria and the Nation-State</em>, former diplomat and Africa expert John Campbell 
        provides a clear-eyed vision of Nigeria and why it matters. 
        Nigeria is a case study of many of the challenges faced by other post-colonial, 
        multi-ethnic countries. With population projections to displace the United States 
        as the third largest in the world by 2050 and as one of Africa’s largest economies, 
        it has democratic aspirations, yet it is undermined by weak governance, terrorism, and insurgency.</p>
    </div> 
    <div>  
    <p>Nigeria is not a conventional nation-state, even if that is how other foreign ministries and international organizations perceive it.
         It is not quite a nation because Nigerians are not united by language, religion, culture, or a common 
         national story. It is not quite a state because the government is weak and getting weaker, and it fails 
         to provide for the security of its citizens, the primary requirement of any state. 
         Instead, Ambassador Campbell characterizes Nigeria as a prebendal archipelago: prebendal because 
         Nigeria’s corrupt elites appropriate public money for private purposes, but prevent the state from 
         breaking apart due to ethnic and religious rivalries out of self-interest. Elites benefit from state 
         preservation through access to revenue from state-owned oil, government contracts, and office, all of which 
         require a formal state. Simultaneously, the elites keep the government weak so they are not challenged, and 
         government authority is restricted geographically to islands in a sea of ungoverned spaces—an archipelago. 
         With this duality, it is a challenge for African democracies to build a mutually beneficial bilateral 
         relationship. Ambassador Campbell concludes with recommendations for different U.S. diplomatic approaches.</p>

                <li>There is no such thing as pre-colonial “Nigeria” as it is fundamentally 
                    a creation of 
                    British colonialism and therefore foreign to the people within it. 
                    The government is 
                    the successor of the colonial government; 
                    there was no revolution at independence, and British officials were replaced by 
                    Nigerian ones.</li>

                <li>Nigeria’s move toward independence was largely spearheaded by 
                    the British rather than a nation-wide independence movement that crossed ethnic divisions.</li>

        <p>  
        <ul>
            <li>Nigerian independence did not undo changes wrought by colonialism, but instead solidified them. 
                Newly independent Nigeria had a government built by British colonial officials; borders drawn by Europeans 
                nearly a century earlier; and it was now part of the post-World War II international state system constructed 
                by the victors.</li>

    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>The Nigerian state is run by a small cartel of self-serving elites. Its purpose is to provide a venue for their 
                cooperation across religious and ethnic divisions, just enough to divvy up state oil revenue among 
                themselves and their clients. They otherwise do little to improve the lot of the vast majority of Nigerians.</li>

        <h1>Speechwriting</h1> 
    </div>
    <p>You were recently appointed as the head of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Bribeopolis. The country has vast reserves of oil, but the state-owned firm controlling production is corrupt and uncompetitive globally. You want to cut down on corruption, and suggest to the new head of the firm (the old one was removed after a scandal) that the company should be privatized. However, this will be politically difficult, as there is a huge amount of national pride in the firm, many people will lose their jobs, and citizens’ access to oil is subsidized. Write a 
        speech that explains to the public why this move is both necessary and beneficial, and be sure 
        to address their criticisms.</p>
